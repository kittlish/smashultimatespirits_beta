<!--
    Objectives Here:
        Redesign.  Keep the same general Melee Trophy Aesthetic, but change some things around, such as:
            Move the character swap arrows to the same area as the image
            Various Responsiveness issues, but especially change font size at certain screen sizes
            [ADD MORE HERE]
        Improve the performance.  This primarily means dont load the entire sidebar at once
        Improve the navigation experience.  It takes too long to scroll through all 1300 spirits in the sidebar, what are some better ways to speed up this process?  Possibly add a searchbar?
        Add a Random Spirit button
