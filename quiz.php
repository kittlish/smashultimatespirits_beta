        Bugfix
            There have been reported issues where the quiz game randomly deletes progress.  I have been using cookies for this, but it should probably switch over to sessions.
        Improve Design
            I don't like the design on this page as it is on the site, but I'm not sure what I want instead, so I'm open to suggestions!
        Add a way for random visitors to "suggest" quiz additions, that are moderated by logged-in admins.  (I think it would be pretty similiar to how admins currently add questions, but sending these to a different table in the DB that the admins can then access and then "approve"/"deny" potential questions.
